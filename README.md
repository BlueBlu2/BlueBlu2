# 👋 Hi, I'm Abdalrhmn Mohamed Hassan

🚀 **Software Engineer | Backend Developer | Clean Architecture Enthusiast**

I’m a **Software Engineer** specialized in **backend development** using **C#, .NET Core, Python, and SQL**, with a strong focus on **Clean Architecture**, **SOLID principles**, and building **scalable, maintainable APIs**.

My background combines **production-level development**, **teaching & mentoring**, and **product ownership**, giving me a solid understanding of how software is designed, built, and evolved in real-world environments.

## 🧠 What I Do Best

- Design and build **RESTful APIs** using **ASP.NET Core** and **Flask**
- Apply **Clean Architecture**, **OOP**, and **SOLID principles**
- Write clean, readable, and testable backend code
- Work deeply with **SQL Server & relational databases**
- Optimize queries, improve performance, and refactor legacy code
- Translate business needs into technical solutions

I care about **code quality, clarity, and long-term maintainability** — not just making things work.
